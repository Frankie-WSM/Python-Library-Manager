In my program, members have email addresses with 4 letter IDs at the front. All of the IDs start with either
xz or xl for instance: xzcn@library.co.uk or xlaa@coldmail.com (the part of the email after the @ doesn't matter).

There are a limited amount of members with existing logs, here is a list of these members:
xzcn, xzsd, xzww, xzag, xzbv, xzwo, xzyc, xzqm, xzpx,
xzbb, xzap, xlrq, xlma, xlaa, xlqp, xlbv, xlko, xlsf

The list of books that can be searched is:

1984, The Martian, Life Of Pi, Night Things, Carrie, The Night Fire, Circe, Neuromancer, The Hunger Games Trilogy, 
A Brief History Of Time, Gone Girl, Ninth House, The Haunting of Hill House, Ring, A Scanner Darkly, Divergent, 
The God Delusion, Columbine, Dune, Hyperion, The Guest List, Jurassic Park, Foundation, The Bourne Identity

Unfortunately the searching is case sensitive.
